    <h2>About <span> Me </span></h2>
    <p>
      I’m Nikita , an enthusiastic and forward-thinking Computer Science student at York University with
      a strong interest in AI, full-stack development, and building meaningful tech solutions. I specialize in
      turning ideas into functional, high-impact applications using technologies like React, Next.js, Python, 
      Flask, Firebase, and GPT-4. Whether it's streamlining operations or enhancing user experience, I love solving 
      problems through code.My journey in tech has been driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to making a difference.
      I thrive on challenges and enjoy collaborating with diverse teams to create solutions that matter. I'm especially drawn to roles in AI/ML, 
      software engineering, and digital transformation, 
      where I can combine creative thinking with technical execution. On campus, I contribute as a CS Delegate 
      and Finance Chair with Lassonde Student Congress, and I previously led orientation efforts as a Frosh 
      Week Leader. These roles have honed my leadership, collaboration, and organizational skills.
